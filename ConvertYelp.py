Processes one of 3 Yelp JSON files.  It reads in the JSON data, extracts the fields
needed from that file, and writes the result to a CSV file.

The "json" and "csv" libraries are used for handling the input and output.  The encode
method is used to handle unicode characters that appear in "name" and "city" in the Yelp
"business" data file and in "name" in the Yelp "user" data file.

To use, type the following commands:

   python ConvertYelp.py yelp_academic_dataset_review.json
   python ConvertYelp.py yelp_academic_dataset_user.json
   python ConvertYelp.py yelp_academic_dataset_business.json
   
   A corresponding .csv file is generated for each run.

def filter_and_convert_to_csv(filename):
  """
  Open the specified file.  The file is either the "review", "user", or "business" file.
  Depending on the type of file it is, read in certain fields and then save the result
  in CSV format.
